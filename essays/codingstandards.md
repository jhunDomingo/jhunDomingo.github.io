If you are or an upcoming programmer, you must have heard about coding standards. You might think its something that is just tedious, or you might think it shouldn’t have ever existed. However, if you think about it, why would a lot of people advise doing something that is tedious and hated for its existence. The reason for following coding standards is to create a format for you and others to improve code.

Coding is just like writing a college essay. You could write an essay with a distinct topic that really hits home on your ideas, however, that doesn’t mean that the essay is perfect. You could have an abundance of grammar and spelling mistakes that could hinder your essays overall performance while having your great ideas that work. The grammar and spelling mistakes in this case would be the coding standards. If you were to have code that were just a block of code, that is like having only a paragraph for your essay. If you were to indent or space incorrectly, it is like indenting your paragraphs incorrectly and having too much or none between your words in an essay.

Sure that coding standards are just like the standards of a college essay, but what benefits does it have for me to use it? Well just like having a proficient essay, it makes it easier to read your contents for the reader. If you were to have irregular coding style or something that just looks weird or out of place it will lead to confusion for others reading your code. Since it is harder to read it will also be harder to debug your code whenever you run into a lot of errors.

For me personally, I found it very helpful when I was a new programmer. Learning that this coding style is used by many people, it is easy to understand and break down other individuals code. It was easier to pick apart my code by finding “paragraphs” that could be a cause of my errors then starting from the top of my wall of code. It is also helpful when working within groups to have similar coding styles to make it feel like you were the one who wrote the code yourself.
