You should use a UI framework like Semantic UI. Semantic UI is a tool that can help create beautiful responsive layouts in HTML. To me Semantic UI is just like a library of functions and methods I could use to easily do things that would cost me more time and effort. 

With my experience it makes coding in HTML/CSS feel less daunting and more like tinkering with the tools I have. It makes me feel like I could do anything with Semantic UI.
You need a button?
```
<button class=”ui button”>Button</button>
```
Oh you need a menu bar?
```
<div class=”ui three item menu”>
	…
</div>
```
Though it is great, it does have its flaws. Its equivalent to learning an entirely new coding language with its own set of rules and such. In the beginning you will feel very overwhelmed with all the different classes that you could use in Semantic UI. By adding or taking away certain classes can entirely change the way you want it to function. It will be very frustrating when you want it to do something but it results in an entirely different way.
```
<button class=”ui green button”>Button</button>
```
Will print a green button instead of a gray one. It looks quite like the previous button code, however, by just adding the word green it changes the look of the button.

```
<div class=”ui vertical menu”>
	…
</div>
```
Instead of horizontal menu bar, it will result in a vertical menu bar just by adding vertical in class. 

Even though it isn’t the perfect substitution in using only raw HTML/CSS, it’s still a good alternative.
