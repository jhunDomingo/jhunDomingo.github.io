Asking questions in Stack Overflow is the most effective way to solve problems you have about programming. Instead of continuously staring at your code hoping that if you stare just long enough that it would solve its own problems, you should ask for help. However, asking a question and asking a good question are two entirely different things. 

<h3>The Low Effort</h3>

This is a prime example of what not to do when asking a question in Stack Overflow. This shows that you haven’t had the slightest of thought about solving your problems at all. Just asking people to do all the thought process for you is the wrong way to post in Stack Overflow. You should refrain from asking questions like “what should I do to solve this assignment?”. Stack Overflow is a source for programmers to help each other to have their programs to be successful not write code for you.

<h3>The What ????</h3>

This example is a little better compared to the previous example, however, it still could take some work. This individual is showing that he isn’t entirely just asking someone to do all his work but a part of his code that he’s confused about. However, this is as stressful for other users trying to help you if you don’t give enough information. Usually sending a snippet of your code isn’t enough information for other users to fully help solve your problems. Surely knowing where your code is breaking is valid information why its breaking is entirely as important.

<h3>A Real Question</h3>

This user’s post is an example of a good question. Ted gives enough information ranging from what he’s trying to achieve with his code to all code that is relevant to his question. Ted was also very specific and clear about what his question is about his code. Simply by reading a few words from Ted and glancing at his snippet of his code you can understand what Ted is asking and what his thoughts are about the problem he is having.

Asking a good question results in a better understanding of what you’re confused about and what information you’re trying to achieve from solving this question to users who are trying to help you. Having the necessary information for someone to understand what your trying to ask, being clear and precise about what your trying achieve, and simply just trying to learn from it then having someone to do all the work makes a good question.
