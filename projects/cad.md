Before majoring in Computer Science Iâ€™ve had 3 years of experience with Computer Aided Design (CAD). During my senior year my teacher for Design Tech II, he had asked me if I wanted to participate for the 2017 Hawaii S.T.E.M. Conference which I gladly accepted his invitation. The objective that year was to create a design which would be beneficial for the community. My group decided to design a standing desk since we believed that the next generation is the perfect source to improve the community.

The standing desk was designed to help those in their classes. We chose a standing desk since it would help students to be attentive in class. As well as give them an option to stand or sit during class instead of constantly sitting. Unfortunately, my group was not successful during the competition and had lost to a McDonalds toy design.
