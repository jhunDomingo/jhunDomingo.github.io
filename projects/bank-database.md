For ICS 212 I had to develop a program that simulates a bank database. The program runs on console and was made in Unix which was coded entirely in C using vim. The bank database consisted of a user interface which lets the user add, delete, print, or print all records in the database as well as quit the program. The database was also required to save all information when quitting the program using read and write files.

This was the very first large project in C I had ever done. If you have any experience in C you would also understand the frustration you could assume, I had many compilation errors while coding this program. However, learning comes with mistakes. I had learned a lot about using pointers and the importance of every part of my code.
