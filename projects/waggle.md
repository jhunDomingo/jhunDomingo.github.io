summary: Created a website as a final project for ICS 314.
---

For ICS 314, we had to create a website based around the prompt containing a problem and solution we were given. The prompt that my group had gotten was Study Buddy.

The problem: ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.

The solution: Study Buddy is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.

My group had been inspired by the way bees communicate with its hive through waggling that we used it as our website theme and our special sauce.
